        <h2 class="text-start">What is Soil pollution?</h2>
        <p class="text-start m-3 fs-5">Soil pollution refers to anything that causes contamination of soil and degrades the soil quality. It occurs when the pollutants causing the pollution reduce the quality of the soil and convert the soil inhabitable for microorganisms and macro organisms living in the soil.

            Soil contamination or soil pollution can occur either because of human activities or because of natural processes. However, mostly it is due to human activities. The soil contamination can occur due to the presence of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, ammonia, petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, nitrate, mercury, naphthalene, etc in an excess amount.</p>

                <P class="text-center fs-5">The presence of heavy metals (such as lead and mercury, in abnormally high concentrations) in soils can cause it to become highly toxic to human beings.These metals can originate from several sources such as mining activities, agricultural activities, and electronic waste (e-waste), and medical waste.</P>

                <P class="text-center fs-5">Waste Disposal is a serious issue that causes soil pollution. Personal waste such as urine and faeces are dumped directly in the form of diapers.Man-made soil pollution is usually caused by the improper disposal of waste coming from industrial or urban sources, industrial activities, and agricultural.</P>

Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been linked to several forms of cancer. These organic compounds can also cause cardiovascular diseases in humans.Soil contamination is the pollution of soil by harmful chemicals or compounds
