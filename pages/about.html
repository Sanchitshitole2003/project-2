      Pollution or environmental pollution is the contamination of air, water,
      soil, or land by solid, liquid, or gaseous substances or any forms of
      energy like heat, sound, and radioactivity. It has adverse or harmful
      effects on human beings, animals, or plants in our environment. The
      substances which are responsible for water pollution, air pollution, and
      land or soil pollution of our environment are called pollutants. Pollution
      is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These
      harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such
      as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash
      or runoff produced by factories.

              <p>Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it is present nonetheless, both on land and under the sea. Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and well-being of humans and other organisms. Sound is measured in decibels.</p>

            <p>12 million tonnes of plastic finds its way into the ocean every single year. 9.5 million tonnes of this enters the ocean from the land with 1.75 tonnes being chucked into the sea directly from the fishing a shipping industry.
