            <h2 class="text-start">What is Thermal pollution?</h2>
            <p class="text-start m-3 fs-5">Thermal pollution is described as an unexpected change in the temperature of natural water bodies such as a lake, ocean, pond, or river by human activities. Thermal pollution generally occurs when an industry uses the water from a natural resource & returns it at a different temperature. Typically, these facilities use it to cool their machinery or aid in producing their products. Humans and governments have made numerous attempts to successfully manage how plants use water to control & maintain thermal pollution adequately.</p>

                    <P class="text-center fs-5">The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. A warming planet means a warming ocean, and a change in water temperature—as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit—can cause coral to drive out algae. Coral may bleach for other reasons, like extremely low tides, pollution, or too much sunlight.</P>

                    <P class="text-center fs-5">A cooling tower is a device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a coolant stream, usually a water stream, to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature</P>

                    <p class="text-center fs-5">A nuclear power plant uses steam to generate electricity. Steam, created by heating water through energy produced by a nuclear reaction, drives turbine blades to spin. This rotational energy is then converted to electrical energy by a generator. A nuclear power plant uses uranium as its fuel.</p>
