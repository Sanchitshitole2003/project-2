        <h2 class="text-start">What is Air pollution?</h2>
        <p class="text-start m-3 fs-5">Air pollution is most common in large cities where emissions from many 
        different sources are concentrated. Sometimes, mountains or tall buildings prevent air pollution 
        from spreading out. This air pollution often appears 
            as a cloud making the air murky. It is called smog. The word "smog"
             comes from combining the words "smoke" and "fog." Large cities in poor and developing nations tend to 
             have more air pollution than cities in developed nations. According to the World Health 
             Organization (WHO), some of the worlds most polluted cities are Karachi, Pakistan; 
             New Delhi, India; Beijing, China; Lima, Peru; and Cairo, Egypt. However, many developed
              nations also have air pollution problems. Los Angeles, California, is nicknamed Smog City.

                <P class="text-center fs-5">Air pollution is usually thought of as smoke from large 
                    factories or exhaust from vehicles. But there are many types of indoor air pollution as well
                    Heating a house by burning substances such as kerosene, wood, and coal can contaminate
                     the air inside the house. Ash and smoke make breathing difficult, and they can stick to walls, food, and clothing.</P>

                <u><h3 class="text-center">Effects On Humans</h3></u>
                <P class="text-center fs-5">People experience a wide range of health effects from being exposed to air pollution. Effects can be broken down into short-term effects and long-term effects.

                    Short-term effects, which are temporary, include illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis. They also include discomfort such as irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin. Air pollution can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea.</P>

                <u><h3 class="text-center">Effects On The Environment</h3></u>
                <P class="text-center fs-5">Like people, animals, and plants, entire ecosystems can suffer effects from air
                     pollution. Haze, like smog, is a visible type of air pollution that obscures shapes and colors. 
                     Hazy air pollution can even muffle sounds
                    Air pollution particles eventually fall back to Earth. Air pollution 
                    can directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil. This can kill crops or reduce their yield. </P>

                <u><h3 class="text-center">Global Warming</h3></u>
                <p class="text-center fs-5">Global warming is an environmental phenomenon caused by natural and anthropogenic air pollution. It refers to rising air and ocean temperatures around the world. This temperature rise is at least partially caused by an increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat energy in the Earths atmosphere. (Usually, more of Earths heat escapes into space.)</p>
