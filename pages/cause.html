                    Burning of fossil fuels:
                    The combustion of fossil fuels pumps out a lot of greenhouse gases. Vehicles are one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions. Moreover, most industries also rely on fossil fuels to power their machinery.<br> <br>
                    
                    Agricultural activities
                    Ammonia is one of the most common by-products of agricultural activities. It is also extremely toxic if inhaled.<br> <br>

                    
                  Mining operations
                  Mining operations are one of the major culprits of air pollution. Toxic substances are released during the operations that may negatively affect the health of the workers and the people that live nearby.<br> <br>
                  
                  Indoor Air pollution
                  Air pollution can also happen indoors â€“ for instance; radon gas is colourless and odourless. It also has the tendency to accumulate inside closed spaces, such as the basements of buildings. This gas is also considered to be a carcinogen; hence it may cause cancer. <br> <br>
